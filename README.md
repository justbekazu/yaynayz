# Yaynayz
YAY or NAY your way to popularity

## Project Description
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

Yaynayz is a useful polling/voting app for finding out quickly if people agree or disagree, want or don’t want, or like or dislike, something, anything. Simple and effective, Yaynayz can be used by your audience without logging on or even making an account.

Questions must be formulated so that they can be answered with a "yay" (yes) or a "nay" (no).

Users wishing to view questions and vote can do so without registering. Session ID is used to identify who has voted and preventing users from voting twice. Once a vote is cast, the user can see the current vote count in a chart.

Features include:
- Anonymous Voting
- Authors must register and create an account (username, email and password)
- Search by Shortcode
- Bar charts showing results
