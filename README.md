# Yaynayz
YAY or NAY your way to popularity

## Project Description
Yaynayz is an app that puts all your questions to rest. With a simple yes or no (yay or nay) to questions you create, you'll get realtime results you can't argue with... but you'll probably argue with them anyway.

## How it works...
A user wishing to post quesions will create a basic account that includes:
* user name
* email address
* password

Once the user creates an account, the user can then post questions. 

Questions are to be in a "yes" or "no" format.

Once the question is made, the user can publish the question, ALL questions will be made public for 24 hours from time of publishing.

Users wishing to view questions and vote can do so without registering. Cookies will be required to vote (this keeps people from voting more than once per question).

Once a vote is cast, the user can see the "real time" or current vote count. 

Users can open the app and see running totals for questions they've voted on. 

The author of the question will recieve an email once the question expires with the total.
