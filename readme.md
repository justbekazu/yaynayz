# Yaynayz
YAY or NAY your way to popularity

## Project Description
Yaynayz is an app that puts all your questions to rest. With a simple yes or no (yay or nay) to questions you create, you'll get realtime results you can't argue with... but you'll probably argue with them anyway.

## How it works...
An author wishing to post quesions will create a basic account that includes:
* user name
* email address
* password

Questions are to be in a "yes" or "no" format.

Users wishing to view questions and vote can do so without registering. Cookies will be required to vote (this keeps people from voting more than once per question). Once a vote is cast, the user can see the "real time" or current vote count. Users can open the app and see running totals for questions they've voted on.
